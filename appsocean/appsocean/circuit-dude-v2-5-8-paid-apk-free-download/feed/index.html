Should I remove this game from this page? Or you are simply encouraging users to buy and support after testing the game from here?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, this is a game that I made... I&#039;m just a single guy who likes to make games. I&#039;d definitely encourage people paying for it through the Google Play Store because it cost a lot of money to make. In fact, I still haven&#039;t made a profit on Circuit Dude, yet. It would be very helpful. Thank you.]]></description>
